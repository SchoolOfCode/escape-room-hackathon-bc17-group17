* By 12:30, you'd want to have read through all the documentation about the hackathon (understand the problem) and been through the Disney Ideation to have an idea, and a rough plan to work towards it.
* By 14:30, you'd want that plan translated into GitHub Issues so you can use them to track progress.
* Also by 14:30 you'd want to create a flow diagram of what you are building.
* Also by 14:30 you'd also want to agree if any work is happening after 14:30, and what the scope and expectation is for that work.
* By 9am tomorrow, those who've completed work should have written up a guide of what they've done so others can follow.
* By 10am tomorrow, you hopefully will get time to build out as a team.
* At 1.20pm tomorrow, you'll present to us your progress.

All information is in the Learn platform and in the GitHub repo README.md file. Spend time to understand what's required and make sure your team are on the same page.
