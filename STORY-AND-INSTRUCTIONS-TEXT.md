Story:
The year is 2052.

Mars has been colonized for three years by Elon Musk’s MarsX company.

But all is not well on Earth...

Musk has been ousted as the CEO of MarsX by his own company’s board for quote: “not being consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities”.

Musk is pushed over the edge and in a fit of diabolical genius plots his revenge...

The next resupply mission to the MarsX colony is not only filled with much-needed provisions but with a sinister stowaway of Musk’s devise.

Enter “ZombElon Musk!”



Instructions:
Escape the MarsX complex, one room and puzzle at a time, and board an earth-bound escape pod.

Do all this before the bloodthirsty ZombElon Musk eats your brains (much to the delight of his nefarious creator who is watching the annihilation via inter-orbit CCTV from the comfort of his Bel-Air mansion).
