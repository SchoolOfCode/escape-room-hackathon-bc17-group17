Escape room task:

Presentation: 
30 seconds to introduce your team members
~1 minute for your reflections on how you worked as a team, what in your project went well, and what youâ€™d improve/change for next time
~1 minute to talk through your flow diagram and your reflections on it
~3 minutes to demo your final product

Each segment to be presented by a different person.




Blue sky: 

- Have many rooms, lots of puzzles, having hidden rooms that unlock after puzzles are passed. (Sayed)


- Escape building and escape city. Bigger scope. Zombified elon musk. Multiple rooms inside a building. Talking to multiple characters and then escaping the building. Needs to be fun have a fun concept (Pieter)


- Escape the planet. Race to mars, colonizing mars. (Bruce)


Potential story line: people gone onto mars, via a space program funded by elon musk. People are turning to zombies you need to warn people on earth/escape. Or Elon is a zombie. 



Realistic and critique: 

What we can realistically build:
-Introduction of starting screen 
-Then the puzzle room 
-Plan for 1 puzzle 


These are extras that we can build if we have time
- If we can do more we can do more 2 puzzles (1 mathematical and one logical maybe)
- Potentially an outro scene
